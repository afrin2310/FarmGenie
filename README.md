🌾 FarmGenie – Smart Crop & Pest Advisor

FarmGenie is a simple, rule-based smart agriculture advisory web application designed to help farmers and agriculture learners make better crop and pest management decisions. The project focuses on knowledge-driven recommendations without using machine learning models or sensors, making it easy to understand, lightweight, and reliable.

📌 Project Overview

FarmGenie recommends suitable crops based on:

Soil type

Season

Rainfall category

Land area (hectares)

It also calculates the required seed quantity, suggests fertilizer usage, and provides basic farming tips.
In addition, the project includes a Pest & Disease Lookup module, where users can identify common crop problems using visible symptoms and receive basic treatment advice.

🎯 Objectives

Assist farmers in choosing the right crop for their land conditions

Provide seed quantity and fertilizer guidance

Identify common pests and diseases using symptom-based rules

Demonstrate practical use of rule-based logic in agriculture
